- UDP port management
- Bedrock templates

---

## Phase 1: Stabilization & UX (v1.8 - v1.9)

### Plugin/Mod browser

- Search Modrinth/CurseForge from panel
- One-click install
- Update plugins

### Scheduled tasks

- Auto restarts at intervals
- Execute commands at scheduled times
- Flexible backup scheduling

### File manager improvements

- Large file uploads (chunked)

### Docker named volumes support

- Allow using Docker named volumes instead of only directory paths
- Requires filebrowser refactor to access volume data
- Volume lifecycle management (create, list, inspect, prune)
- Migration path from directory-based to volume-based storage
- Better isolation and Docker-native approach

**Why not now?**

- Current directory-based approach allows direct file access from Minepanel
- Named volumes require accessing data through Docker API or volume mounts
- Filebrowser currently reads from host paths (`BASE_DIR/servers/*/mc-data`)
- Would need container-to-volume inspection or mount points to read files

### Better log viewer

- Export logs
- Saved log views / presets

### Dedicated server.properties editor

- Validation
- Tooltips for each setting
- Backup before save

---

## Phase 2: Multi-node with Docker Swarm (v2.0 - v2.2)

> Allow connecting multiple VPS from a single panel.

### Dual operation mode

MinePanel auto-detects the environment:

    style A fill:#065f46,stroke:#22c55e,color:#fff
    style B fill:#1e40af,stroke:#3b82f6,color:#fff
```

| Mode           | Description                   | Use case                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Standalone** | Docker Compose, single server | Current setup, no changes needed |
| **Swarm**      | Multi-node cluster            | Multiple VPS, auto balancing     |

### Node management

- View nodes connected to swarm
- Status of each node (online, resources)
- Labels for organization (gaming, modpacks, etc.)
- Instructions for joining new nodes

### Server-to-node assignment

- Node selector when creating server
- "Automatic" (wherever resources are available)
- Specific node selection
- By label (e.g., "only nodes with SSD")

### Technical changes

- IOrchestrator interface abstraction
- LocalOrchestrator (current Docker Compose)
- SwarmOrchestrator (new)
- OrchestratorFactory (decides which to use)

### Cloud backups

- Supported providers:
  - S3 / Compatible (MinIO, Backblaze B2, Wasabi)

- Retention policies
- One-click restore

### Metrics & Monitoring

- CPU/RAM per server (historical)
- Players per hour/day
- Uptime tracking
- TPS monitoring
- Prometheus integration (optional)

### Alerts

- Log errors
- Notify via Discord/Email

- Favorites (frequent servers at top)
- Global search
- Import/Export configs
- Copy server (clone configuration)
- Bulk actions (start/stop multiple)
- Server groups/folders
- Better toast notifications
- Reverse proxy helper (NGINX/Caddy)
- Resource limits UI
- Config import/export

---

## Maybe (future consideration)
